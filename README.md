# Pre-requisites

1. Have Node.js installed.

## Challenge 1

1. Execute "node c1.js" in your terminal (Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, CMD.exe, & etc).
2. "output.js" will be generated in project folder.

## Challenge 2

1. Execute "npm install" to install dependencies.
2. Execute "node c2.js".
3. Output will be displayed on console log.


# Missing points
1. Missing package dependency for installation
2. Eye for details: 
- unstandardized usage of let & var
- c1: BIGBANG on output, despite BIG BANG on text.
- c2: decimals were set on currency output rather than exchange rate
